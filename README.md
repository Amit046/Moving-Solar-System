# Moving Solar System

This project is a dynamic visualization of our solar system, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the Sun and the planets orbiting around it with simulated movement, offering an engaging and interactive way to explore the basic structure of our celestial neighborhood.

## Features

* **Visual Representation:** Displays the Sun at the center with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) visually represented in their approximate order from the Sun.
* **Simulated Movement:** Planets are animated to move along their respective elliptical-like orbital paths around the Sun, providing a sense of their continuous motion.
* **Interactive Controls:** Includes intuitive "Start" and "Stop" buttons, allowing users to easily control the animation and observe the planetary movements at their own pace.
* **Built with Web Technologies:** Leverages the fundamental web technologies of HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling the visual elements (colors, sizes, orbits), and JavaScript for implementing the dynamic animation and button functionalities.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the semantic structure for the solar system elements (Sun, planets, orbits) and the interactive controls (Start/Stop buttons).
* **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance of all elements, defining their colors, sizes, shapes, and the paths of the planetary orbits, creating an aesthetically pleasing representation.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the core logic for the animation, calculating and updating the positions of the planets over time to simulate their orbital movement. It also handles the event listeners for the "Start" and "Stop" buttons to control the animation flow.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you are using version control):
    ```bash
   https://github.com/Amit046/Moving-Solar-System
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
3.  You will be presented with a visual representation of the solar system.
4.  Click the **"Start"** button located on the page to initiate the animation of the planets orbiting the Sun.
5.  To pause the planetary motion at any time, click the **"Stop"** button. Clicking "Start" again will resume the animation.

## Potential Future Enhancements

* **Planet Details:** Implement interactive elements that display key information about each planet (e.g., name, relative size, approximate orbital period) upon hovering or clicking on them.
* **Scalability and Accuracy:** Explore options to make the relative sizes and orbital speeds of the planets more scientifically accurate.
* **More Celestial Bodies:** Consider adding other significant celestial bodies within our solar system, such as the Moon orbiting Earth, major moons of other planets, or the asteroid belt.
* **User Controls:** Introduce controls to adjust the animation speed or zoom level for a more personalized viewing experience.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the solar system visualization adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
